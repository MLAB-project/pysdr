# The Interface

Coordinates are in OpenGL-space. y increases upwards.

Functions always called with the OpenGL context active:

   gl_init()
       will be called once before the other GL-related functions.

   gl_reshape(w, h)
       notifies about a change in the window size.

   gl_draw()
       should redraw the contents, a call can be requested by req_update.
       gl_reshape will be called at least once before the first gl_draw call.

Functions which should not assume active OpenGL context:

   key_press(key)

   mouse_btn(left, pressed, x, y)

   mouse_motion(x, y)
